# The Graph Network - Econometric Analysis & Predictive Modelling Research

This cadCAD model and notebook series is part of an on-going effort to analyze The Graph protocol's econometric design, simulate its behaviour under different market conditions, and create tools and libraries which can be used by the community to better understand its behaviour.

## About The Graph
The Graph Network decentralizes the API and query layer of the internet application stack.
 - In The Graph Network, any Indexer will be able to stake Graph Tokens (GRT) to participate in the network and earn rewards for indexing subgraphs and fees for serving queries on those subgraphs.
 - Consumers will be able to query this diverse set of Indexers by paying for their metered usage, proving a model where the laws of supply and demand sustain the services provided by the protocol.


## What is cadCAD?
cadCAD (complex adaptive dynamics Computer-Aided Design) is a python based modeling framework for research, validation, and Computer Aided Design of complex systems. Given a model of a complex system, cadCAD can simulate the impact that a set of actions might have on it. This helps users make informed, rigorously tested decisions on how best to modify or interact with the system in order to achieve their goals. cadCAD supports different system modeling approaches and can be easily integrated with common empirical data science workflows. Monte Carlo methods, A/B testing and parameter sweeping features are natively supported and optimized for.
